GIT INSTRUCTIONS

Create a local git repository

	* git init - to initialize an empty git repository
	* touch .gitignore - to create an empty gitignore file. Update it with suitable data depending on your project
	* git add . - use to stage all files in the current directory and sub-directories, use relative paths if specific files 			need to be added
	* git commit -m "your message here" - commit the currently staged files

To add remote repository:
	* git add remote origin <your-repo.git>

To push to the master branch of the repository with alias 'origin'
	* git push -u origin master

Create a new branch:
	* git branch new-branch - new-branch will be created from the currently checked out branch

Checkout to a different branch:
	* git checkout different-branch

Create and checkout to a new branch:
	* git checkout -b new-branch - creates 'new-branch' from the current branch and checks out that branch.

Push a new branch to remote
	* git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-local:new-branch-remote - push the local branch(left side of :) to a branch(right 			side of the :) on the remote repo.
	* git push origin :remote-branch-name - delete the remote repo
	
Remove unstaged changes:
	* git clean -f -d  > -f for files and -d for directories

Unstage commited changes:

	* git rm -r --cached . > unstage all changes(including commited ones). Use this to apply gitignore post commit.
