There are three most widely used type conversions: to string, to number and to boolean.

ToString – Occurs when we output something, can be performed with String(value). The conversion to string is usually obvious for primitive values.

ToNumber – Occurs in math operations, can be performed with Number(value).

The conversion follows the rules:

Value	Becomes…
undefined	NaN
null	0
true / false	1 / 0
string	The string is read “as is”, whitespaces from both sides are ignored. An empty string becomes 0. An error gives NaN.
ToBoolean – Occurs in logical operations, or can be performed with Boolean(value).

Follows the rules:

Value	Becomes…
0, null, undefined, NaN, ""	false
any other value	true
Most of these rules are easy to understand and memorize. The notable exceptions where people usually make mistakes are:

undefined is NaN as a number, not 0.
"0" and space-only strings like " " are true as a boolean.
